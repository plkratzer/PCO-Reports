# PCO-Reports
Custom Reports for Planning Center

These are reports that I've written up for my church. I'm not exactly a whiz with coding so they might not be a good example of "best practices" but they get the job done. I'm always happy to receive feedback!

## Version 1.0 Release - 1/11/18
Version 1 is locked down and contains 3 reports:
* Mail Merge (Full-page mail merge letters)
* Attendance Checklist (Printable attendance sheets)
* Grade Report (Summary of what grade students are in)
