# Mail Merge

This is a particularly interesting report. It creates a mail merged letter, but pulls the content of the letter from a Google doc. This makes it easy to change the contents of the letter, and have someone who is unfamiliar with HTML or Liquid change the report if needed.

This report is best generated as a PDF file.

# Attendance Checklist

This report generates a checklist that can be printed off and used to take attendance. Be default it will put an asterisk by any name that is a member, and will break out those tagged as Visitors to a separate block.

It also has a few lines at the end for writing in the name of guests.

This report is best generated as an HTML file.
